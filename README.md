# Turn-Based 3D RPG

## Project State
This project is in the early stages of development. Currently, it features a camera system and basic movement controls. No gameplay or combat systems are implemented yet.

## Project Intentions
The goal of this project is to create a turn-based 3D RPG inspired by classic turn-based games. Planned features include:
- Turn-based combat system
- 3D world exploration
- Grid-based movement and pathfinding
- UI for debugging and gameplay

## Requirements
- CMake (for building the project)
- C++ compiler (MSVC, GCC, or Clang)
- OpenGL (for rendering)
- GLFW (for window/context management)
- GLM (for math operations)


## Building
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries (see above).
3. Use CMake to configure and build the project.

## Notes
- The codebase is modular, with separate folders for core logic, engine, gameplay, rendering, UI, and world management.
- Contributions and suggestions are welcome as the project evolves.
